I am a PhD with 10 years of experience working with data in a biological environment. I create software in several programming languages including Python, MATLAB, and R.  

As a **scientist**, I explore 
- <a href='https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1620939114'>Neural coding</a> to understand how information is represented in neural activity, 
-  <a href='https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00023/full'>Brain State</a> to relate how brain activity is linked to brain state (i.e. sleep, to arousal), 
- <a href='https://opg.optica.org/optica/fulltext.cfm?uri=optica-8-12-1613&id=466023'>Microscopy</a> to push the limits of imaging technology
